hypothesis :- 

The index BANKNIFTY is dependent on 9 constituent banks namely: -

HDFC,SBI,ICICI,AXIS,KOTAK,FEDERAL,BANDHAN,INDUSIND,RBL
the changes in 15 minutes time window of each bank is provided in the columns [B:J]

column K contains BANK NIFTY change in the similar time frame
column L is up_shifted BANK NIFTY by 1 which we try to predict 

we are trying to extrapolate the movement of the banks to the next 15 minutes depending
on the movement of the constituents banks movement
